# Fejix Window Management Library

Hello there! FejixWM is a library for managing windows, a routine that is a necessary base for GUI applications.

The philosophy is this: nobody ever cares about windows, the only interesting things are the graphical surfaces, which
you can actually use to draw graphics.

> This is a work in progress... I can't wait to see the first release!
